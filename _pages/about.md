Biography
======
I joined the Department of Micro-Nano Electronics at the School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University as a tenure-track Assistant Professor in May 2023. Prior to this, I obtained my Ph.D. degree from Peking University in 2017, specializing in research on artificial intelligence accelerators. During my doctoral studies, I conducted academic visits at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in 2015-2016 [Alumni page](https://vast.cs.ucla.edu/people/alumni/chen-zhang). After graduation, I joined Microsoft Research, where I worked on cloud-edge-end artificial intelligence systems and heterogeneous acceleration. I progressed to the position of Senior Researcher. In early 2021, I joined Alibaba T-head Semiconductor Co., Ltd., leading the parallel computing team as a Core Chip Architect, responsible for artificial intelligence algorithm acceleration and cluster chip interconnect-related functional design.

Since 2012, I have been engaged in research related to AI chip design, witnessing the emergence and growth of the new generation of parallel processor architectures represented by AI chips. Over the past decade, I have focused on the architecture of AI systems and design automation, achieving comprehensive optimization of software and hardware architectures through cross-layer vertical integration of "algorithm-system-hardware." This approach has continuously pushed the performance boundaries of AI chips, supporting the rapidly increasing demand for computing power. In the aforementioned research areas, I have published 21 papers in internationally recognized conferences and journals, including 10 CCF-A papers. My work has garnered over 2000 citations for a single paper. I have received several awards and honors, including the FPGA-15 Best Paper Nomination, first place in the list of the most highly cited papers in FPGA Conference history [ACM Library](https://dl.acm.org/event.cfm?id=RE116), the Donald O. Pederson Best Paper Award for 2017-2019 (the first mainland Chinese recipient) [Peking University webpage](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/info/1305/2155.htm), [UCLA webpage](https://www.cs.ucla.edu/2019-donald-o-pederson-best-paper-award/),  2021/2022/2023 AI 2000 Most Influential Scholars in AI Chip Technology (Top-2) [CKCEST](https://www.aminer.cn/ai2000/ct), and being recognized as a top 2% highly cited scientist in Computer Hardware and Architecture in 2019/2021 by Elsevier. I have also received the ACM Chinasys Rising Star Award, among others.

I am committed to conducting research that combines academic contributions with industrial impact. During my Ph.D. studies, the FPGA AI accelerator performance modeling and automated design methods that I developed have been referenced and used by nearly all companies involved in AI hardware, including Google, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Xilinx, and AMD. During my visit to UCLA, the automated AI acceleration framework based on FPGA high-level synthesis (HLS) was adopted by tens of thousands of users and successfully implemented in the startup company Falcon Computing (acquired by Xilinx in 2020). During my time at Microsoft, I achieved significant technology transfer through my research, and the heterogeneous hardware acceleration technologies I developed have been deployed and applied in various levels of Microsoft's cloud-edge-end AI systems. For my outstanding contributions, I received the Dean's Special Award from Microsoft Research. The sparse neural network acceleration methods I proposed have been applied in NVIDIA's next-generation Ampere and Hopper architectures in sparse tensor operation units.

In March 2021, I joined Alibaba Pingtouge Semiconductor Co., Ltd., with the aspiration to help domestic chips surpass their international counterparts. As one of the core architecture team members, I have been involved in the complete development process of the Pingtouge AI parallel computing chip, including design, verification, production, and tape-out. I have been responsible for multiple architectural research and implementation, including high-performance inter-chip interconnect architecture, distributed communication software and hardware interfaces, and memory models. As the only academic collaborator in the Pingtouge parallel computing team, I am dedicated to bringing international advanced research achievements to the engineering team, including new-generation sparse tensor operation units and Transformer accelerators. I have also led and facilitated research collaborations between multiple research teams and the Pingtouge technology research team.

个人简介
======
我于2023年5月加入上海交通大学电子信息与电气工程学院微纳电子学系，任长聘教轨助理教授。此前，我于2017年从北京大学博士毕业，主攻人工智能加速器研究。期间于2015-2016前往美国加州大学洛杉矶分校学术访问。毕业后加入微软研究院，从事“云-边-端”人工智能系统及其异构加速。任职至主管研究员（Senior Researcher）。于2021年初加入阿里巴巴平头哥半导体有限公司并行计算团队。作为核心芯片架构师，负责人工智能算法加速及集群芯片互联相关功能设计。

自2012年开始，我从事AI芯片设计的相关研究，经历了以AI芯片为代表的新一代并行处理器架构从萌芽到壮大的过程。在这十余年中，我专注于面向人工智能系统的体系结构和设计自动化的研究，通过对 “算法-系统-硬件”的跨层次垂直整合，通盘完整的软硬件架构优化，不断突破AI芯片的性能瓶颈，支撑高速增长的算力需求。围绕上述研究方向，我在体系结构、EDA和人工智能重要国际会议和期刊发表论文21篇（其中CCF-A类10篇）。最高单篇论文引用量超2000余次。并获得多项奖励和荣誉，包括FPGA-15最佳论文提名，FPGA会议历史高被引论文第一名 [ACM Library](https://dl.acm.org/event.cfm?id=RE116)，Donald O.

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
